## 🎯 Career Objective

About 2 years of experience as a full-stack engineer has equipped me with expertise in microservice architecture and strong proficiency in modular/component-based development. I currently leverage this skillset to architect and build user-friendly, responsive UIs for secure financial transactions within a complex enterprise software system, utilizing Angular and Spring Boot microservices. To stay ahead of the curve, I am actively expanding my knowledge of fintech solutions like Internet Banking and e-Wallets.
